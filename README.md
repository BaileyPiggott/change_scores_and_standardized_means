###Change Scores and Standardized Means

Descriptions of the files within this repo:

__LOAC_VALUE_paired__: Calculate standardized means for VALUE scores for engineering, drama, and physics and plot.

__LOAC_CAT_paired__: Calculate standardized means for CAT scores for engineering, drama, and physics. Also, separate engineering scores into the 10 disciplines and plot their change scores.

__LOAC_CLA_paired__: Calculate standardized means for CLA scores for engineering, drama, and physics. Also, separate engineering scores into the 10 disciplines and plot their change scores.

__LOAC_change_scores__: Plots standardized change scores for each instrument(CAT, CLA, and VALUE) for each of the three main programs studied(engineering, drama, psychology). Also plots change scores for the 10 engineering disciplines for the CLA and CAT on a dodged bar plot.

__LOAC_means_by_department__: Facet plot of the change scores for the CAT, CLA and VALUE for engineering, drama, and psychology. Also has a facet plot of the standardized means of all 10 engineering disciplines for the CAT and CLA.
